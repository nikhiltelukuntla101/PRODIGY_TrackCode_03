## Description

A simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against an AI opponent. The AI randomly selects an empty square to place its marker. This game is implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Two-player game**: Play against a human opponent on the same device.
- **AI Opponent**: Play against a simple AI that makes random moves.
- **Win Condition Check**: The game checks for winning combinations and announces the winner.
- **Draw Detection**: If all squares are filled and no one wins, a draw is declared.

- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic and handling player and AI turns.

## How to Play

1. The human player (`X`) plays first.
2. Click on any empty square to place your marker (`X`).
3. After the playerâ€™s move, the AI opponent (`O`) will automatically take its turn by selecting a random empty square.
4. The game continues until a player wins by placing three markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or a draw occurs when the board is full.
5. Press the **"Reset Game"** button to restart the game at any time.

## Game Logic

- **Winning Conditions**: A player wins if they align three of their markers in a row. This could be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
- **AI Logic**: The AI makes random moves, placing its marker (`O`) in any available empty square.
